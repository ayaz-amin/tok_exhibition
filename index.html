					<p style="color: rgb(244, 247, 250); offset: 20px;">VAEs are statistical models that were first introduced in 2013 as a way to perform Bayesian inference – a powerful way of computing probabilities by modelling the probability distribution of data (i.e. generating the data, such as the image of the "9" above) – on large datasets.</p>
					<p style="color: rgb(244, 247, 250);">Before the introduction of VAEs, statistical models could not perform computationally efficient inference because they did not scale well with the size and dimensionality of datasets, restricting them to simple or toy data.</p>
					<p style="color: rgb(244, 247, 250);">VAEs aleviate these problems, making them a perfect example of knowledge that improves upon previous knowledge.</p>

				<div class="img" data-aos="flip-left"><img src="imgs/coadf.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
					<p style="color: rgb(244, 247, 250);">‘Chronicle of a Death Foretold’ is a novella by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in which the narrator returns to his hometown in order to investigate a murder that took place many years ago. The story is told in the form of a pseudo-journalistic reconstruction, in which the narrator tries to piece together the sequence of events that lead to the murder of the character Santiago Nasar. While the murder was commited entirely in the open by the Vicario brothers out of restoring honour to their sister Angela, the various different narrations of the sequence of events that lead to the crime contradict each other. As such, the more information about the murder is gathered, the less it is understood.</p>
					<p style="color: rgb(244, 247, 250);">
						While the events in the novella are entirely fiction,
						it reveals a lot about the confusing state of knowledge
						in the real world. More specifically, it touches on the
						theme of bias and uncertainty of human memory, and why it
						does not always improve upon previous knowledge. For example,
						many real-life court cases end up sentencing innocent people
						due to the failure of witness information reconstructing the
						true events. It suggests that current information does not always
						improve upon previous knowledge, at least in the context of the 
						justice system.

					<p style="color: rgb(244, 247, 250);">
						The light bulb is a device that converts electricity into light. Light bulbs play a role so large in our lives that we take it for granted at times. Before light bulbs became mainstream, oil lamps and candles were used, which were not as effective and could not illuminate large areas at once. Light bulbs have an interesting history of rapid development from various experiments that were performed by independent inventors. Light bulbs work by passing electricity through a filament, transforming it into light. However, because the filament gets very hot (as hot as 2,800 Kelvin), most materials either melt or burn. Around the 1840s, Warren De la Rue came up with the idea to put the filament in a vacuum bulb to prevent reaction with oxygen, in turn preventing the filament from melting / burning too soon. By 1879, Thomas Edison had built a light bulb that lasted 14 hours before the filament burnt. As other inventors experimented with different materials, such as platinum and other carbonized materials, the lifespan of light bulbs began to increase until today.
					</p>
					<p style="color: rgb(244, 247, 250);">
						The extremely rapid research and development of light bulbs in a very short period of time is a testament to the fact that knowledge in the sciences is an improvement over previous knowledge.
